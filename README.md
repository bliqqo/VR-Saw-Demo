# VR Saw Demo
 Virtual Reality Hand Saw Demo
 By Andrew Barras
 
  This program lets you cut virtual wood planks from the safety of your living room! (very exciting)
 
  To use, drag the handsaw over the wood and perform  a sawing motion to cut the wood into pieces.
 
  This was Developed with Unity's OVR Development kit with Oculus integration, because this is the headset I am most accustom to working with.
 
  Additionally, the Workplace Tools assets by Ilias Kap were used for the 3D models.
 
 
 -EZY Slice Version-
 
  Ezy-Slice API framework by David Arayan was utilized in the project for its scripts building  the foundation for Cutting 3D meshes.
 
  Due to time constraints and ease of development, the hand saw is connected to the right hand. 
 
 -My Version-
 
  I reworked the original project using my own framework to slice the mesh.
 
  I have also added sawing sounds, sawdust particles.
